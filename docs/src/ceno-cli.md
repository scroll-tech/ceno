# The `ceno` CLI

The `ceno` command-line interface is the primary way to interact with the Ceno ZKVM. It allows you to build, run, and verify your ZK programs.

The available commands are:

- `cargo ceno build`: Compiles a guest program written in Rust into a RISC-V ELF file.
- `cargo ceno info`: Provides information about a compiled ELF file, such as its size and segments.
- `cargo ceno keygen`: Generates a proving key and a verification key for a guest program.
- `cargo ceno prove`: Compiles, runs, and proves a Ceno guest program in one go.
- `cargo ceno run`: Executes a guest program.
- `cargo ceno verify`: Verifies a proof generated by `cargo ceno prove`.
- `cargo ceno raw-keygen`: A lower-level command to generate keys from a compiled ELF file.
- `cargo ceno raw-prove`: A lower-level command to prove a program from a compiled ELF file and a witness.
- `cargo ceno raw-run`: A lower-level command to run a program without the full proof generation, useful for debugging.

For detailed usage of each command, you can use the `--help` flag, for example: `cargo ceno run --help`.
